# Depression Detection - App -Flutter

One of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents is depression. Often, a person going through mental health issues hesitate to consult a counselor. So, the purpose of our project is to create an app that will analyze a personâ€™s facial features and also analyze their social media activities which will be used for predicting if that person is depressed or non-depressed and if depressed then what is the level of depression in that person.
